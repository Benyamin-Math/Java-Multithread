# Java-Multithread
This is a mathematics-based multithreading Java code.
In this code, we apply multi-threading feature to find the prime numbers from 1 to n, when n is a natural number imported by user. 
This code, decomposes this range into m parts, where m is the number of threads which is also requested from user. 
Then, it finds all primes in the smart intervals and writes each list in a new seperated file. 
Enjoy from this code and its short running time for long integers!
